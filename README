verboseflag
===============
Add support for ``--verbose``, ``-v``, ``-vv``, ``-vvv``, ``-vvvv``,
and ``-vvvvv`` to your argparse and logging configuration.

How to use
----------------
Add the flag to your argument parser, ::

    import argparse
    import verboseflag
    package_list = ['name_of_my_package', 'name_of_my_other_package']
    p = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    verboseflag.add_arguments(p)

and use the logging module for anything that you might want to print. ::

    import logging
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.info('Blah blah blah')

Once you have set this all up, call ``parse_args`` on you argument
parser. (This is how you normally use argparse; I'm just mentioning
it in case you haven't used argparse before.) ::

    settings = p.parse_args()

``parse_args`` takes a list of shell tokens, using ``sys.argv[1:]``
by default. You can test your argument parser by passing something
else to it. ::

    settings = p.parse_args(['-vv'])

The verbosity level is set in the ``verbosity`` property.
The last thing you need to do is to pass this to
``verboseflags.configure_logging``.

    verboseflags.configure_logging(settings.verbosity, package_list)

The next section discusses the significance of ``package_list``,
``__name__``, and ``logger.info``.

Behavior
------------
verboseflags configures the logging module to log data to STDERR,
and it limits the output depending on which verbosity flags you set,
if any.

If you set **no flags**, the logs are limited as follows.

* All critical and error messages are emitted.
* Warnings from the packages specified in ``package_list`` are
  emitted. (More precisely, only warnings from loggers whose names
  start with the listed package names are emitted.)

If you set ``--verbose`` or ``-v``, (They're equivalent.) info level
messages from the listed packages are emitted, along with everything
that would have been emitted with no verbosity flags set.

If you set ``-vv``, then debug level messages from the listed packages
are emitted, along with what would have been emitted if ``-v`` was set.

If you set ``-vvv``, then warnings from all packages are emitted,
along with everything above.

If you set ``-vvvv``, then info messages from all packages are emitted,
along with everything above.

And if you set ``-vvvvv``, debug messages from all not-listed packages
are emitted, along with everything above; that is, all logging messages
from all packages/loggers are emitted.

If you set more than five Vs, you'll get an error.
